geneFu: R package providing various functions relevant for gene expression analysis with emphasis on breast and ovarian cancers.

Version 2
This version includes major updates of gene expression signatures, subtype classification methods, and prognostic signature predictors. Some updates include the addition of recent gene signatures (now includes adding Crins and Yoshihara signatures for ovarian cancer), updates to PAM50 subtype probabilities classification and rorS functions, and addition of the IntClust and AIMS subtyping and Claudin-Low subtyping schemes for breast cancer.
